			On January 15, 2022, Michelle Go, 40, of Manhattan, was pushed in front of an R train as it approached a 42nd Street platform one morning. The attack was random, and injected New Yorkers with grief and the collective fear that they might be the next victim.
			<br>
			<br>
			In fact, in today’s world, it is 12x more likely that they <i>are</i> the next victim. With the onset of Covid-19, the number of violent subway felonies in New York City has spiked to 6 per million rides, which roughly equates to one victim every four hours.
			<br>
			<br>
			Having moved to the city four months prior to the Go attack, I too was feeling anxious on my daily commute. This anxiety is ultimately what fuelled my investigation on how digital technologies might alleviate some of the fear felt while riding the subway, and overall make it a safer and more pleasant place to be.

		To understand this, we first need to look at the history of the New York subway system. In the 90s, there were approximately 19 felonies/million rides. Comparatively, this number was down to 0.5 felonies/million rides in 2019. This was found to be because of an increase in subway-policing, and the fact that ridership had over doubled in that time, making it at a record-high.
		<br>
		<br>
		And then 2020 happened. With the pandemic, the number of violent felonies spiked to 6 felonies/million rides because police resources were strained by Covid-19, so the enforcement of transit crimes fell to nearly zero. Compared to previous decades, the subway is still quite safe since the number of felonies per million people is less than a third of what it was; but, the <i>abrupt acceleration in crime</i> is the biggest we’ve seen in history, so ridership is low.

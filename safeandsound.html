			On January 15, 2022, Michelle Go, 40, of Manhattan, was pushed in front of an R train as it approached a 42nd Street platform one morning. The attack was random, and injected New Yorkers with grief and the collective fear that they might be the next victim.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>In fact, in today’s world, it is 12x more likely that they <i>are</i> the next victim.</b> With the onset of Covid-19, the number of violent subway felonies in New York City has spiked to 6 per million rides, which roughly equates to one victim every four hours.
			<br>
			<br>
			Having moved to the city four months prior to the Go attack, I too was feeling anxious on my daily commute. This anxiety is ultimately what fuelled my investigation on <b>how digital technologies might alleviate some of the fear felt while riding the subway</b>, and overall make it a safer and more pleasant place to be.

		<span id="caption">&#8593; Observational Research: Crime on the 42nd Street station platform.</span>
		<br>
		<br>
		To understand this, we first need to look at the history of the New York subway system. In the 90s, there were approximately 19 felonies/million rides. Comparatively, this number was down to 0.5 felonies/million rides in 2019. This was found to be because of an increase in subway-policing, and the fact that ridership had over doubled in that time, making it at a record-high.
		<br>
		<br>
		And then 2020 happened. <b>With the pandemic, the number of violent felonies spiked to 6 felonies/million rides because police resources were strained by Covid-19, so the enforcement of transit crimes fell to nearly zero.</b> Compared to previous decades, the subway is still quite safe; but, the <i>abrupt acceleration in crime</i> is the biggest we’ve seen in history, so ridership is low.
		<br>
		<br>
		Interestingly, even though crime goes down with increased ridership, most people that still do ride today, ride alone. Notably, most people are alone at the time of being a victim of subway crime.

	Women’s <i>fear</i> of subway crime is more of a problem than crime itself

	<span id="caption">&#8593; Primary Research: Subway-related fatalities by gender, <i>1990-2003.</i> (<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022437508001333" target="_blank">Source</a>)</span>
	<br>
	<br>
	100% of the female interviewees from my user research voiced concerns about being pushed into the subway tracks. Interestingly, this fear isn’t justified by statistics which consistently show low rates of crime against women in subway spaces. <b><i>Men</i> actually constitute 84% of subway suicides, accidents, and homicides in the past decade; women, only 16%.</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Probing a bit deeper, I wanted to understand <i>why</i> and <i>what</i> exactly women are scared of, and the most common theme I found was the unexpected.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Women are scared of the unpredictability and randomness of certain crimes and behaviors.</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	In my research, I found another explanation for this fear, and it’s that women have a greater propensity to think of past experiences of victimization in present situations. <b>The irony is that women are more fearful of subway crimes than men, but men are more often victimized.</b>
</span>
	<br>
	<br>
<span id="bigpoint">
	Women modify their behaviors in ways that make themselves feel <i>mentally</i> safer, but not necessarily <i>physically</i> safer on the subway system
</span>
<button onclick="myFunction3()">&nbsp?&nbsp</button>
<span id="shelf3">
	Again, 100% of my female interviewees reported modifying their behavior when on the subway, most notably by standing in the middle of the platform; sitting in the middle of the train so that they don’t get robbed as people exit; and not listening to music so as to remain alert.
	<br>
	<br>
	What especially struck me interesting, was when one interviewee said she carries mace and a pocket knife for self defense and holds them to <i>feel</i> safer, but quote on quote said:<br><br> <b><i style="color:#4669ef">“I don’t even know what I’d do though. I’d probably injure myself before someone else. It’s more of a mental security thing.”</i></b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Comparatively, one of the answers from a male interviewee in response to: “how do you practice subway safety?”, was that he’s never thought of the subway as a safety risk, even though he’s had more than one experience of assault on a platform. At those times, he reported only feeling concern about the safety of his girlfriend he was with at the time.

	<br>
	<br>
	That leaves us with two insights: (1) <b>women modify their behavior in ways that offer more mental than physical protection</b>, <i>again</i> even though they are less often victimized; and (2) <b>men have less fears about their safety so many don’t take safety precautions</b>…but then are found to be victims of more crimes.

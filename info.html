			When I was fourteen, I downloaded Adobe InDesign to make a four-page newsletter for a retirement home down the street. Hours later, with tears in my eyes and a newsletter typeset in Comic Sans, I asked myself: who would want this as a job?
			<br>
			<br>
			Nine years later, I now keep two computers at my desk: Illustrator and Photoshop open on the left, Figma to my right. Their internal fans moan in harmony with me as I hit save on my “newfinalfinal_FINAL” file. Apparently, I did. I wanted that job. I’ve since grown to find motivation in the most stressful of situations, and clarity in the madness that can be pushing pixels around a 13-inch screen.
			<br>
			<br>
			With two design degrees and nearly a decade of design work and under my belt, I have had multidisciplinary experience as a graphic designer, crafting everything from logos to fair trade apparel; as a UX designer, conducting research and design for new human-centered products and organizations; and as a layout designer, typesetting professional reports, creative handbooks, and all else in between. Next, I’m looking to learn how to bring my layouts to life through motion graphics.
			<br>
			<br>
			I’m also trying to learn how to sustainably survive on only coffee and three hours of sleep, and perhaps being a bit less of a yes-woman.
			<br>
			<br>
			(Unless you have a design opportunity, then please feel free to reach out. I love design, I love work, and I’m always looking for new design work.)

			When I was fourteen, I downloaded Adobe InDesign to make a four-page newsletter for a retirement home down the street. Hours later, with tears in my eyes and a newsletter typeset in Comic Sans, I asked myself: <b><i>who would want this as a job?</i></b>
			<br>
			<br>
			Nine years later, I now keep two computers at my desk: Illustrator and Photoshop open on the left, Figma to my right. Their internal fans moan in harmony with me as I hit save on my ‚Äúnewfinalfinal_FINAL‚Äù file. <b>Apparently, I did. I wanted that job.</b> I‚Äôve since grown to find motivation in the most stressful of situations, and clarity in pushing pixels around a 13-inch screen at 1200% zoom.
			<br>
			<br>
			With two design degrees and nearly a decade of design work and under my belt, I have had multidisciplinary experience as a graphic designer, crafting everything from logos to fair trade apparel; as a UX designer, conducting research and design for new human-centered products and organizations; and as a layout designer, typesetting professional reports, creative handbooks, and all else in between. Next, I‚Äôm looking to learn how to bring my designs to life through motion graphics.
			<br>
			<br>
			I‚Äôm also trying to learn how to sustainably survive on only coffee and three hours of sleep, and perhaps being a bit less of a yes-woman.
			<br>
			<br>
			(Unless you have a design opportunity, then please feel free to reach out. I love design, I love work, and I‚Äôm always looking for new design work. üòä)
